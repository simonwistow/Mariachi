0.4	Thursday 26th June, 2003
	Now we ship with a lurker-style output.

	template paths are specifyable

	template directories will be scanned for non-template files,
	and those that exist will be copied into the output tree

	Mariachi::Message now has first_line, first_sentence and
	others, to allow extra context in the thread index pages.

	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES: 
	
	Command line interface changed.  Now instead of positional
	parameters we use named ones.

	Mariach->{list_name,input,output,threads_per_page} have all been
	replaced with a single AppConfig instance, C<config>

0.31	23rd May, 2003
	New distribution, without the failing t/0signature.t

0.3	23rd May, 2003
	Fixed Message->from

	Tweaks to thread output - only display subject where it's
	different from the previous one

	Italicise quoted sections of email

	Added new body_sigless and sig methods in message.

	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Filename generation has changed from
	using md5_base64 to md5_hex for aesthetic reasons. This will
	break links for existing installations.

	Distribution includes a passthrough Makefile.PL for CPAN.pm users
