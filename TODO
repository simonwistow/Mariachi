=head1 Build.PL files installer

the one in Albazo looks like just the one I've been imagining for
Siesta, if slightly more fully featured.  must steal

=head1 Configuration

commandline/inifile kinda thing.  I think this is probably what
AppConfig is good for, and we're already using TT so it's worth a look

=head1 Internals documentation

as always.  needs to cover subclassing, since we kinda support it, but
I'm sure that we'll assimlate ideas rather than subclass in many
instances

=head1 website/usage docs

an install guide.  maybe some PRish bumf benchmarking it in comparison
with mhonarc/pipermail.  a logo.  how to install with your existing
mailman system.  finished templates
