=head1 allow specification of template dirs

=head1 copy non-templates from template dirs into the output path

=head1 Build.PL files installer

customise location, place value as default into a tiny generated

as always.  needs to cover subclassing, since we kinda support it, but
I'm sure that we'll assimlate ideas rather than subclass in many
instances

=head1 website/usage docs

an install guide.  maybe some PRish bumf benchmarking it in comparison
with mhonarc/pipermail.  a logo.  how to install with your existing
mailman system.  finished templates
